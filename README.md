**_ Product Folder _**

Product page is the why i would like it to show and look like.

<!-- Note: something that cool with using Typography on bring in your product i and with commercejs.com in the description part it will bring in <p> tags i of them to get rid of them in the Typography of the description just do this <Typography dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: product.description}} and that should do it. Very Nice!! -->

** NavBar Folder **

---

Navbar.jxs the of page to aline the top and to re-direct to the shopping cart if you have items or not and give you the total, with keep all the styles the same on the Navbar.

note: when using Badge from material-ui/core it a count for how many items are in the cart as a static right now will be fixing later.

Badge will no longer be static today as this what i be working

** Cart Folder \***

---

with the cart folder it's adding to shopping cart and if your shopping cart dosnt have items it well tell you that you do not have items and cart, also when you added more items it well add total of what in your cart and give you it.

still working on style the cart page more but going to leave it for now but to it in a moment??
